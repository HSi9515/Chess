Remember to commit all code to your own branch when you've tested something successfully and think it's worth taking a 
"snapshot" (saving the version). When things from different branches are ready to function together, we'll merge them. 
(This would be a lot easier with Git Bash working on our laptops so our laptops themselves can keep track of branches and 
versions. But we're probably not allowed to get it...)

Player representations:
1 = white
2 = black
3 = filler
  * but we should code our project to focus less on a filler being 3 and more on it NOT being a 1 or 2 

White will start on the bottom of the board and black on the top. 

The Order of rows from top to bottom are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
and columns from left to right are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
